# Virtual Pet Shelter Amok

I started with the Virtual Pet Shelter app and built from there. I built tests for each organic dog, cat, and robotic dog and cat.
I used Virtual Pet as the parent class and made Organic Pets and Robotic Pets to be children classes of Virtual Pet which housed variables that all organic pets and all robotic pets needed.
I figured out that I would need to implement a few interfaces for walking the dogs and increasing and getting the attributes as I could define the methods that each needed.

I used TDD to drive the development of the new methods that I needed for this application and built up from there. I found out that I could house the variable used for the litter box in virtual pet shelter and have it affected there.
I used my tick method to find if each pets health goes down or up based on the pets attributes such as cleanliness and hunger and thirst. 

I tested the app and made sure everything worked which it did.
